## Next Steps?
- Designed with Mobile in mind
- Checking out CSS frameworks like https://tailwindcss.com
- Some errors with links, see Bancroft school
- Information about degrees available
- MongoDB backend to store information (Began, ran out of time)
- More precise searching (i.e. Search for schools with Admission Rates > x and SAT scores > y)
- Incorporating more of the Data Set into each table expansion... feels a little light on information
